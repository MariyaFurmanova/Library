# About the repository
Here you can find all scripts from the RbxScript.com

~~All scripts are official~~, I have no right to add something of my own to these scripts.

Scripts, that names starts with **un**, are universal

You maybe will think, why you are reposting scripts here. I am posting scripts, that are obfuscated. Agree, it is very convenient that long scripts can be pushed into the loadstring!
# How to execute scripts?
1. Choose the game you want
2. Open the Raw version of this script
3. Copy this link, and paste it inside the loadstring
4. You will get code like that: loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MariyaFurmanova/Library/main/TridentSurvival"))() . You must add after the name of script .lua, like that loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MariyaFurmanova/Library/main/TridentSurvival.lua"))()
5. Copy this link and paste into your executor. Your script will be done
